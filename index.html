    Welcome to our International Catholic Community!
  </h1>
  <p>
    The beginnings of this English-speaking Catholic Community
    date back to September 2013. Those who
    had until then participated in the celebrations of the
    American Military Catholic Community made plans to fill the
    gap that was left when the American Forces left Heidelberg.
  </p>
  <p>
    In September 2013, we celebrated our first Mass
    in English language in the Church of St. Michael in Heidelberg's Südstadt.
    Since then, every Sunday at 1p.m., the community gathers to celebrate Holy Mass, <strong>as of July 2025 in St. Bartholomäus in Wieblingen</strong>. 
    Bringing together a people from all over the world, the community 
    serves Catholic faithful from far and near; from established families to expatriate workers 
    of international companies, exchange students and tourists who find themselves in the area. Despite
    their many different backgrounds, cultures and languages,
    our community members are united through the bonds of their
    faith.
  </p>
  <p>
    Apart from our Sunday Mass, we offer regular occasions to
    receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation. Of course, the
    celebration of other sacraments is possible as well. Once a
    month, the community meets for a Social Gathering where we
    interact with one another over some fingerfood.
  </p>
  <p>
    ICCH is part of the Catholic City Church of Heidelberg
    ("<a href="http://www.stadtkirche-heidelberg.de/">Stadtkirche Heidelberg</a>").
    As a community whose activities are organized by
    volunteers, it depends on the help of everyone present.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>A small but growing and active community, we are always happy to welcome guests and newcomers!</strong>
