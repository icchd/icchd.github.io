# December 1, 2024 First Sunday of Advent
<span style="float: right"><em>Welcome Father Eckhard</em></span>
**Today's Readings:** Jer 33:14-16 | 1 Thes 3:12—4:2 | Lk 21:25-28, 34-36


<img style="float: left; margin-right: 1em;" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/12th-century_painters_-_The_Tree_of_Jesse_-_WGA15728.jpg/333px-12th-century_painters_-_The_Tree_of_Jesse_-_WGA15728.jpg">

Central theme: Advent is a time of waiting for Christ, allowing Jesus to be reborn in our lives. It is also a time for purifying our hearts by repentance and for renewing our lives by reflecting on and experiencing the several comings (advents) of Christ into our lives. Besides coming into our world through birth, Jesus comes into our lives through His Church and its members, through its Sacraments (especially the Holy Eucharist), the Word of God, the worshipping community, and finally, in His Second Coming

Scripture lessons summarized: In the first reading, the prophet Jeremiah waits and hopes for an ideal descendant of King David who, as the Messiah of God, will bring security, peace, and justice to God’s people. Christians believe that Jeremiah’s waiting and hoping were fulfilled in Jesus. Jeremiah’s prophecy assures us that the Lord, our Justice will fulfill His promises, and, hence, that we need not be afraid, despite frightening events and almost universal moral degradation. The Psalmist expresses the central idea of patient, vigilant, prayerful waiting for the Lord in today’s Responsorial Psalm (Ps 25), singing, “Your ways, O Lord, make known to me; teach me your paths, guide me in your Truth and teach me for You are God, my Savior.” In the second reading, Paul urges the Thessalonians to continue and intensify the life of holiness and mutual love he has taught them as they wait for “the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His holy ones.” In today’s Gospel, Jesus prophesies the signs and portents that will accompany his Second Coming and encourages us to be expectant, optimistic, vigilant, and well-prepared: “When these signs begin to happen, stand erect and raise your heads, because your redemption is at hand” (Lk 21:28). Jesus wants us to face the future with confidence in God’s providence.

Life messages: 1) We need to prepare ourselves for Christ’s second coming by allowing Jesus to be reborn daily in our lives. Advent gives us time to make this preparation — repenting of and confessing our sins, renewing our lives through prayer, penance, and sharing our blessings with others. In Advent, we also ought to check for what needs to be put right in our lives, to see how we have failed, and to assess the ways in which we can do better. Let us accept the challenge of the German mystic Angelus Silesius “Christ could be born a thousand times in Bethlehem – but all in vain until He is born in me.” Quoted in Messenger of The Heart: The Book Of Angelus Silesius, With Observations By Frederick Franck (2005)

2) A message of warning and hope: The Church reminds us that we will each be asked to give an account of our lives before Christ the Judge, both at the moment of our death (“private Judgment”) and at Jesus’ second coming (“The Last Judgment”). Today’s readings invite us to assess our lives every night during Advent and to make the necessary alterations in our thoughts, words, deeds, and omissionns, in the light of the approaching Christmas celebration. Amid the tragedies that sometimes occur in our daily lives and the setbacks in spiritual life, we must raise our heads in hope and anticipation, knowing that the Lord is coming again.
