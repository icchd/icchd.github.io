In the Readings for today we have two interesting examples of hospitality as the setting for a more important teaching: that of listening. When we gather family or friends together to share a meal, or even an extended visit, we do so not only to provide them and ourselves with the necessities of food and drink, but to talk with them and to hear what they have to say in return. So a good host or hostess will want to engage their guests in lively conversations on many subjects because what is shared during these visits will be remembered long after what is eaten.
The First Reading is from the Book of Genesis (18:1-10a).Abraham was a Bedouin nomad living in the remote areas of what is now Iran or Iraq. Although wealthy, he had few if any neighbors, so strangers of any kind were welcomed in that society. They provided news of other areas and interesting stories to fill their time. However, the “strangers” of this story were no ordinary strangers. They were messengers from God, and this was the fulfillment of one of he great promises God made to Abraham —the beginning of a large family, the Jewish nation. The details and time of the meal preparations are omitted because they were not important to the point of the story. The real point here is in the last line of the reading: "I will surely return to you about this time next year and Sarah will then have a son." Would not this be remembered long after the meal was over?
The Responsorial Psalm is (15:2-5). This is a prayer extolling the virtues of the upright man who is just and charitable. It combines the essence of Wisdom with the practical aspects of Proverbs. Unfortunately, the first line is omitted. This helps us to fit it into the scene of the first reading and it reads: "0 Lord, who shall sojourn in your tent? Who shall dwell on your holy mountain?" In earlier years, tents were used as tabernacles or places of worship until temples or churches were built.
The Second Reading is from St. Paul's Letter to the Colossians (1:24-28). Although this passage is not about hospitality perse, it is about listening and following through. This passage also brings us around to the point that Jesus is making in the Gospel reading: listening to the Word of God is far more important than creature comforts or duties. Paul's statement about"... filling up what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ" refers to his (Paul's) portion of God's Plan of Salvation that was given to him to fulfill. We are all given a small portion of this divine plan (the "hidden mystery") and our spiritual food, the Eucharist, is needed to fulfill it.
The Gospel Reading is from the Gospel of St. Luke (10:38-42). Again, we have a familiar story: that of Martha and Mary of Bethany, sisters who, along with their brother, Lazarus, were close friends of Jesus. Martha was deeply involved in providing a good meal for Jesus while Mary was more concerned with receiving a spiritual meal from Jesus — His words of divine wisdom. Jesus did not rebuke Martha. He just pointed out that Mary had chosen the more important part of hospitality, that of listening.
Have you ever thought of the Sunday Mass as a banquet and you as an invited guest? It is, and it has the necessary ingredients for great hospitality. In this banquet we have great forms of communication: prayer and singing; lessons of instruction and guidance; and we have the divine bread of life and the cup of salvation. This being so, why then is everyone in such a hurry to leave, sometimes before the host gives the last blessing? What do YOU remember about last Sunday's “banquet?” Something to think about during your prayer time this week!
