**Jesus did this as the beginning of his signs at Cana in Galilee and so revealed his glory, and his disciples began to believe in him.** *John 2:11*

John’s Gospel is commonly divided into four sections: the Prologue, the Book of Signs, the Book of Glory and the Epilogue (which contains the resurrection appearance in Galilee). Today’s Gospel comes from the beginning of the Book of Signs, which begins at Chapter 1:19 and continues through Chapter 12. In this section, the Apostle John presents us with seven “signs,” which are seven miracles Jesus performed. Each sign has a deeper spiritual meaning that reveals Jesus’ divinity and mission. In many ways, the entire Book of Signs prepares us for the Book of Glory in which Jesus’ “hour” of glory is identified with Him taking up His glorious throne of the Cross, fulfilling His mission as the “Lamb of God” Who offers His life for the salvation of all, and pouring forth His grace and mercy from His wounded side.

The first of seven signs Jesus performs in John’s Gospel is the changing of water into wine at the Wedding of Cana, which was done in superabundance! The six stone jars, filled to the brim with water, were transformed into as much as 180 gallons of the finest wine. The changing of water into wine was done at the request of Jesus’ mother, who told the servants to do whatever Jesus told them to do.

There is certainly much to ponder in this incredible miracle. One specific thing to consider, as we begin reading the first of these signs, is that Jesus uses His miracles to prepare His disciples for the “hour” of grace and glory that is to come. And though the hour of Jesus has already taken place in time, it’s important to understand that each one of us needs to go through the process of preparing for that hour in our own lives. We must let Christ continuously prepare us for the hour of glory by which we receive Him and all the grace He won for us on the Cross. This preparation will take place in our lives, just as it was presented in John’s Gospel. Jesus’ seven signs, His miraculous actions, were performed to prepare His disciples to receive all that He bestowed on the Cross. We must not only prayerfully reflect upon these signs as recorded by John throughout the year, we must also look for the many personal signs that our Lord gives to each one of us.

Just as the participants at the Wedding of Cana were left in amazement at the miracle of Jesus, so we must allow ourselves to become continuously amazed at His action in our lives. The seven signs that are recorded in Scripture, as well as the effect of our spiritual pondering of them, must become beacons of light that prepare us to come to know our Lord more fully and to receive the grace won by His Cross of glory.

Reflect, today, upon this, the first of Jesus’ signs. Try to meditate upon this story as a way of preparing yourself to receive His grace more fully in your life. Think of the superabundance of the miracle and ponder the fact that it points to the superabundance of grace God wants to give you. Reflect, also, upon the fact that it took place by the intercession of Jesus’ dear mother. She also will anticipate your needs and pray for you with her motherly heart. Ponder the beautiful meaning and symbolism in this passage so that you will more fully share in God’s abundant glory.

*My glorious Lord, Your entire earthly life was a preparation for the hour in which You gave Your life as a sacrifice on the Cross for the remission of sins. Please continuously prepare me to receive You more fully and to open my heart to You and all that You have bestowed upon me through Your perfect sacrifice of love. Jesus, I trust in You.*
