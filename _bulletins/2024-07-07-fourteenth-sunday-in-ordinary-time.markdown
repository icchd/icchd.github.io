# July 7, 2024 Fourteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time
<span style="float: right"><em>Welcome Father Eckhard</em></span>
**Today's Readings:** Ez 2:2-5 | 2 Cor 12:7-10 | Mk 6:1-6

**Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his native place and among his own kin and in his own house.” So he was not able to perform any mighty deed there, apart from curing a few sick people by laying his hands on them. He was amazed at their lack of faith.** Mark 6:4–6

Why was Jesus “not able to perform any mighty deed” in His hometown of Nazareth? Because the people who had known Him since He was a youth lacked faith in Him. But why wouldn’t Jesus simply perform awe-inspiring miracles with the hope of winning them over? Why not try to convince them by raising someone from the dead or by revealing His transfigured glory to His kinfolk, as He did on the Mount of Transfiguration to three of His disciples? The answer goes to the heart of the workings of faith in each soul.

Jesus’ goal in His hometown was not to convince the people that He was the Son of God, the Messiah. He could have easily convinced them of this by the most incredible of miracles and proved Who He was. But doing so would have undermined the reason He came. He came to ignite authentic faith in people’s hearts, not to convince them through clever reasoning or by the proof of miracles. Miracles were offered to those who already had faith, so as to increase their faith and to show them mercy. But when one lacked faith, a miracle could not increase that which was absent. It might have convinced them on a rational level, or at least impressed them greatly, but that is not true faith.

By analogy, say your spouse said to you, “I love you,” and your response was “Prove it.” How would they do so? What could they do to prove that they truly love you? Perhaps they could show charity, kindness, compassion and the like. These qualities certainly are manifestations of authentic love. But deep down, no one can prove they love another. Instead, love must be offered and received in a spiritual way. When that happens, each person somehow simply knows they love and are loved. This is the mystery of spiritual and authentic love.

The same is true with faith. Faith can’t be proved. It can’t be analyzed rationally. It must be embraced and lived. If the people in Jesus’ hometown were to have faith in Him, this gift of faith would start within their own souls. They would look at Him and listen to Him. By their openness and a special personal revelation from God, they would come to know and to believe Who He was. Faith comes first from within, when God communicates to the heart.

Reflect, today, upon your own level of faith in Jesus. When you look into your own soul, what do you see? Do you see a heart that knows Christ Jesus as its Lord? Have you discovered the presence of God within you, speaking to you, revealing Himself to you? Or do you primarily look for external signs and proofs of God’s presence and love? Look into your soul today and ponder the depth of faith that you discover there. When you discover this gift, gaze at it with love, for you are seeing God’s revelation of Himself to you.

*My revealing Lord, You continuously speak to me in the depths of my heart, revealing to me Your divine presence and love. Give me a heart that is truly open to You on the deepest level, so that my faith will grow and I will know for certain Your divine love. Jesus, I trust in You.*
